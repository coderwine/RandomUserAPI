**Random User / Avatar API**

- The purpose of this project is to pull from two simple APIs and display an "ID Card".  We will then use the age of our randomly generated "user" to determine what avatar will be pulled.

- We will look at the documentation to decide how we will pull the information and figure out how to route our information so that we can display it.

**What will NOT be covered:**

- HTML / CSS:  These files have already been filled out and will mostly be used for reference points.
